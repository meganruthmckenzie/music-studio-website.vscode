<h1>The Things Tak Wrote</h1>
<body>
<p class= "red">The first thing Tak did, he wrote himself </p>
   <p> The second thing Tak did, he wrote the laws</p>
     <p>The third thing Tak did, he wrote a cave</p>
    <p>The fourth thing Tak did, he wrote a geode, an egg of stone</p>
    <p>And in the gloom of the cave, from the egg the two brothers were born
