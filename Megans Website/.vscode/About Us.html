    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>McKenzie Music Studios got its start at a little cottage
        in Argyle Texas, ten years ago.  Back then, the Studio
        was just an upright piano, a shelf of books, and a calendar 
        in the corner of my tiny living room.  Now, while I still 
        teach from home, McKenzie Music Studios boasts its own special
        space, complete with baby grand piano, electronic keyboard, basic
        recording equipment, and a library of music.  As a music teacher,
        I believe that the experience of learning a new instrument should
        be fun, challenging, and mind-opening.  My students and I study
        music theory, usually through games at our theory table.  We learn
        pieces that students express interest in, and grow dreams from 
        the piano bench.  And along the way, we learn a bit more about 
        ourselves.  Won't you join us?  Click on the Private Lesson
