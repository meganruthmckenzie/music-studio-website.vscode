    <h2>Let's Work Together</h2>
    <p>Here at McKenzie Music Studios, we believe in collaboration.  We offer stellar lessons in piano 
        and voice, but there are other instruments out there, and there's no way we can teach everyone in 
        our area without some assistance! Want a referral? We're willing to help. Go to our scheduling link 
        to request an appoinment.  Before we refer you, we need to observe how you teach, and ask you
        a few quesitons about your expertise.  Once we're sure that you're an exceptional teacher, we'll
        post a link to your website or contact information. Need some space for your lessons?  Maybe
        we can share what we've got! Email Megan McKenzie at meganruthmckenzie@gmail.com for more 
        information.</p>
