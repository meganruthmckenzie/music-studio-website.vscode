    <h1>Private Lessons</h1>
    <p>McKenzie Music Studios currently offers private lessons in piano and voice.  Megan McKenzie,
        proprietor and teacher, has a Masters Degree in Piano Performance from Texas Woman's University,
        and has been teaching for fifteen years.  She has a vocal secondary from Howard Payne University,
        and has had training as a Broadway vocalist.  See our <a href ="#">Schedule</a> for more information
        about our availability.
    </p>
    <h3>Who Can Take Lessons?</h3>
    <p>For traditional private lessons, children should be able to read and have a basic knowledge of 
        addition and subtraction.  Age 7 is an excellent time to begin learning piano or voice. 
    </p>
    <h3>What About Preschoolers?</h3>
    <p>Megan has developed a pre-school program designed for young children who are interested
        in playing the piano or singing.  Children who are ages 4-6 are eligible for this program.
    </p>
    <h3>Can Adults Take Lessons Too?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! Whether you took as a child, and want to pick up where you left off, or music 
        is a completely new journery for you, we can find a curriculum that works for where you are 
        right now.
    </p>
    <h3>How Do You Teach?</h3>
    <p>At McKenzie Music Studios we believe that the purpose of private lessons is to help each student
    achieve their personal music goals.  During the first lesson, Megan will ask why a student wants
    to learn piano or voice, and what kind of music the student wants to be able to play or sing.  
    Yes, we even ask these questions to preschoolers.  We've gotten some pretty cool answers from them!
    Whatever reason a student or parent has for enrolling in lessons, we aim to focus
    on a way to help the student make learning music something that they love, and look forward to.
    Megan does not insist that students learn particular styles, such as classical music. At 
    McKenzie Music Studios, we make sure that all of our students have a strong foundation in music
    theory and structure, but we can acheive this strong foundation by learning all kinds of music-from 
    Mozart to Taylor Swift! </p>
