<h1>React Testing</h1>
<p>You know, today has been a pretty good day, all things considered. Ladon has been crazy, but I've seen
    worse.  React is a pretty cool language.  I hope I'm getting it right.  Although, as I type this, I'm 
    starting to notice more and more red squiggly lines.</p>
    <ol> my hopes for the rest of the day are:
        <li>Find that darn notebook</li>
        <li>Make a great supper</li>
        <li>Read at least a bit more Percy Jackson. Good books make life awesome.</li>
     </ol>
